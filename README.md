# Physics

This is a simple physics sandbox made using vanilla HTML, CSS and JS.

The web app is hosted at [physics.ozansap.com](https://physics.ozansap.com). \
It does not work on mobile.

## Features
- [x] - Circle to circle collisions
- [x] - Springs that connect two circles
- [x] - Editable world settings (gravity, drag, timescale)
- [x] - Editable circle settings (mass, bounciness, size, color)
- [x] - Editable spring settings (length, stiffness, damping)
- [x] - Adding circles dynamically
- [x] - Interacting with circles by holding and pushing
- [x] - Deleting objects

## Mouse Modes
* `q` - **Hold** - Drags objects around
* `w` - **Push** - Drag from an object to charge, release to hit
* `a` - **Circle** - Create a circle at the cursor position
* `s` - **Spring** - Connect two objects with a spring **(WIP)**
* `x` - **Delete** - Delete objects and springs

## Planned Features
- [ ] - Adding springs dynamically
- [ ] - Rectangle objects
- [ ] - Rectangle collisions
- [ ] - Save/load function
- [ ] - Sharing complex objects

## Significance
This is the first webapp that I built. I wanted to learn the foundations of web development so I decided to build a website using vanilla HTML, CSS and JS instead of starting with a framework like Vuejs or React. I used HTML Canvas to draw into the screen.

I encountered many problems that I had to solve on my own. Even though this project helped me learn the basics of HTML, CSS and JS, I did not enjoy vanilla web development process. Everything felt clunky and unintuitive. That's why, for my future projects, I plan on learning a framework like Vuejs or React as it will probably make my life easier. 

JavaScript being a dynamically typed language is also annoying when working on a big project with lots of functions and data. That's why, for my future projects I plan on learning TypeScript.

This website also does not work on mobile at all. Users cannot switch mouse modes, screen does not fit properly and dragging does not work. I plan on making my future projects mobile friendly.
